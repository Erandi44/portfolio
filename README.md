## Who Am I ?
I am a Computational Chemist with over 8 years of research experience in Cheminformatics, Machine Learning, DFT, and Molecular Dynamics, backed by a Ph.D. in Chemistry. My analytical mindset leads me to explore various perspectives, igniting my curiosity and creativity when it comes to problem-solving. Beyond work, I am an avid traveler, and a photpgrapher embracing the joy and adventure that come with exploring new horizons.



### Education
- Ph.D., Chemistry | University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT (2019)
- BSc., Chemistry | University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka (2010)

### Work Experience
#### Postdoctoral Research Associate | Ames National Laboratory, Ames, IA (2022 - present)
- Organized and curated large datasets, selected relevant features using python, scikitlearn and trained and validated neural network models using Chemprop software to predict binding affinities of metal-ligand complexes with 86% accuracy
- Used chemometric techniques such as PCA and partial least squares (PLS) multivariate regression to predict metal-ligand binding affinities using spectroscopic data

#### Postdoctoral Research Associate | University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT (2019 - 2022)
- Collaborated with a team of multidisciplinary researchers to build a computational model via molecular simulations and cheminformatics techniques to facilitate the identification of unknown metabolites in biofluids using Mass and IR spectral data which resulted in the correct identification of 59%


#### Research Assistant | University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT (2012 - 2018)
- Collaborated with multidisciplinary researchers to design flavin-C60 (FC60) molecule. Calculated its conformational and electronic space and demonstrated the charge transfer characteristics of FC60 self-assembly around single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), which has profound importance in nanostructured optoelectronic devices
- Deciphered the preferential C60 localization around flavin-wrapped nanotubes via molecular dynamics and DFT calculations, demonstrating site-specific molecular recognition of flavin helices
- Characterized the XRD pattern of SWNT nucleated FMN (flavin mononucleotide) crystals and simulated its crystal packing. Interpreted the underlying notion of selective flavin assemblies on specific chiral nanotubes 
- Validated the stability and organizational pattern of different flavin derivatives around SWNTs through spectroscopic techniques and computational modeling 
- Developed new methodology to control porosity in monolayer surfactant coatings around carbon nanotubes 
- Mentored undergraduate students and high-school students in their research projects, which resulted in poster presentations at research symposiums
