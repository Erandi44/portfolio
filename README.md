# Computational Chemist
I am a Computational Chemist with over 8 years of research experience in Cheminformatics, Machine Learning, DFT, and Molecular Dynamics, backed by a Ph.D. in Chemistry. My analytical mindset leads me to explore various perspectives, igniting my curiosity and creativity when it comes to problem-solving. Beyond work, I am an avid traveler, embracing the joy and adventure that come with exploring new horizons.


### Education
- Ph.D., Chemistry | University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT (2019)
- BSc., Chemistry | University of Peradeniys, Sri Lanka (2010)

### Work Experience
#### Postdoctoral Research Associate | Ames National Laboratory, Ames, IA (2022 - present)
- Organized and curated large datasets, selected relevant features using python, scikitlearn and trained and validated neural network models using Chemprop software to predict binding affinities of metal-ligand complexes with 86% accuracy
- Used chemometric techniques such as PCA and partial least squares (PLS) multivariate regression to predict metal-ligand binding affinities using spectroscopic data

#### Postdoctoral Research Associate | University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT (2019 - 2022)
- Collaborated with a team of multidisciplinary researchers to build a computational model via molecular simulations and cheminformatics techniques to facilitate the identification of unknown metabolites in biofluids using Mass and IR spectral data which resulted in the correct identification of 59%
